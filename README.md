RE Practice Version of [the Pokedex repo](https://github.com/skydoves/pokedex-compose) which has
some hidden 'features'.

## Prompt

This Pok√®dex app has odd behavior shown to only specific users, but we can't find the code for it.

Find the hidden component, without looking at the sources :)

  <summary>Hint 1</summary>

  The app makes use of Hilt so most code is not 'directly' connected due to generated classes.

  <summary>Hint 2</summary>

  Avoid 'diving deep' into Compose from onCreate. It is tedious to do so due to R8 Lambda Groups. Instead, try searching for suspicious strings like "Base64"

<details>
  <summary>Hint 3</summary>

  The app performs Dynamic Code Loading (DCL). The DCL payload is encrypted. How can we decrypt it? Where is this code?
